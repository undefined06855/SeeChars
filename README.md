# SeeChars
#### A small `html` and `javascript` project that shows you what makes up your string.

The invisible character RegExp came from [`printable-characters`](https://github.com/xpl/printable-characters) and it does miss a few, but it does a good job. I would explain how it works, but I don't know.

The rest of the code is self-explanatory.
